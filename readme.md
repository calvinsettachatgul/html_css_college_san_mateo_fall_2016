Writing Assignments:

Weekly programming assignments.

Reading Assignments:

Reading assignments accompanied by self-test questions and running code examples.

Other Outside Assignments:

Studying posted lecture notes and relevant handouts. Computer programming assignments. The reading

assignment frames the concepts covered and provides the basic knowledge necessary to do the self-test

questions and understand the sample code. The lecture notes and handouts provide a more in-depth look at

topics and distills the information down to what the faculty thinks is most important. The programming

assignments provide hands on practice of the concepts covered in the readings.

REPRESENTATIVE METHODS OF EVALUATION

Representative methods of evaluation may include:

A. Group Projects

B. Homework

C. Lab Activities

D. Projects
