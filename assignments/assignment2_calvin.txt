Due date: 7th September

1q.
a. Describe the different types of positioning used in CSS. 

There are four different position values:

static
relative
fixed
absolute

An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way; it is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page:
An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position.
An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled. The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to position the element.
An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).
